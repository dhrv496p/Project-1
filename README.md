The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its 
computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses 
(for non-majors). The task is to perform exploratory data analysis on the survey dataset that is provided. The analysis will inform 
the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset), so that they can focus 
their recruiting efforts in those areas that are successful, particularly for under-represented groups. I have sorted the data for the major's
survey, and then having to create charts for the questions.
